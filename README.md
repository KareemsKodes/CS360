Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The App I designed was an inventory application meant for tracking inventory of things people might have. The requirments were to have a login page, a data base of information displayed in an editable table, and a system to notify a user if something was low in stock.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
There were three main screens, a login/signup screen, an inventory table screen, and a settings screen for managing notifications. I tried to keep everything as simple as possible. The less complicated the interface, the easier it is for a user to use.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I started by creating a proposal for a possible design. I then created the layout for the application. Then I created as much of the backend as I felt like creating. In the future, there will not be any need for these strategies because I have no plans to develop a mobile application. If I was going to, I would approach it similarly to how I did with the projects in this course.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I did not perform any testing aside from running to application's login page to make sure it showed up. No functionality testing was done and my code was incomplete. I was aware that it was not complete, and therefore did not perform any tests since I knew none of it would work. If I had completed all of the backend code, I would have run the application in an emulator, ensured functionality was there and that all items were laid out properly.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
In this course I had to come up with creative ways to have the application at a point were I was satisfied with how it looked. Creating an idea of the design, then laying everything out in android studio. The most difficult part was making all of the useless code for my design. There were a lot of things to be done which did not feel necessary. 

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I was particularly successful in creating a plan for monetization of the application. It is a relatively simple scheme of ideas that resonate well, so coming up with the app launch plan was done much better that the actual implementation of the application.
